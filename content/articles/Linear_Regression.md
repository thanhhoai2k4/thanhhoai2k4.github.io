### 1. Introduction


Linear regression is a Supervised Learning algorithm. It's purpose is to find relationship between
the independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of the new feature. Linear regression models are often used to predict the value of a continuous number such as salary, house price, age,...

A traight line is a representation of the linear regression model.

**Example the about figure:**

Linear regression equation: $$Y = \theta_1 + \theta_2 X$$

This is a simple linear regression model. it's only has one independent variable and one dependent variable. Looking ad the piture, it is displayed in two-dimensional space.
