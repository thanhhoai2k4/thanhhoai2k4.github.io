      <description>Tab of content Tab of content 1. Introduction 1. Introduction the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems. When traning, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything from the data but mechanically memorizes it. Therefore, this algorithm is called as Lazy Learning. With KNN in classification problems, the label of a new data point is innferred from its K nearest data points.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to find relationship between the independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of the new feature. Linear regression models are often used to predict the value of a continuous number such as salary, house price, age,&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, my name’s Thanh Hoai. I&#39;m currently studying at the SaiGon Teachnology University.&#xD;I’m a sophomore at University of Information Technology. I really like computer science. I&#39;m very happy to be&#xD;here to day. I want to share my understanding of Artificial Intelligence with everyone to convey:&#xD;Người vá trời lấp bể Kẻ đắp luỹ xây thành Ta chỉ là chiếc lá Việc của mình là xanh&#xA;Source: Trái tim người lính (thơ), Nguyễn Sĩ Đại, NXB Thanh niên.</description>
